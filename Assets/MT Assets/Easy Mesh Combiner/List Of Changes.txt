/////////////////////

v3.0.3
	- Now the officially supported minimum version is Unity 2019.4 or higher. Support for this version of Unity or
	  higher will make it possible to add different new features and improvements in the future. This change also aims
	  to ensure that the tool can always have mature, stable and continuous update support!
	- Minor layout adjustments have been made to the Mesh Combiner Tool's UI to ensure greater perfection in the
	  latest Unity versions.

v3.0.2
	- Added one more helpful hint to Easy Mesh Combiner documentation.

v3.0.1
	- ** WARNING: This is a major update for the Easy Mesh Combiner! Several improvements have been made and
		 incredible new additions too! **
	- 
	- The documentation has been completely redone and updated as well. Now the new documentation is more modern
	  and more beautiful, it can be found in the folder "_Documentation/Documentation.html" and you can open it
	  directly from within your Unity Editor. If your project still has the old "Documentation.zip" file, you can
	  delete it without any problems.
	- Some fields that were used only for internal codes, but which were not used for external scripts, were hidden
	  to avoid confusion.
	- Some minor changes, optimizations and improvements have been made to the Editor UI.
	- Some extra warnings have been added to make sure you stay on top of everything before merging!
	- Now, after the merge is finished, Easy Mesh Combiner will display the merge processing time.
	- The Combined Meshes Manager has been rewritten to adapt to the new functions of the Easy Mesh Combiner. He
	  also underwent some minor optimization and UI changes.
	- The Combined Meshes Manager UI will now adapt according to the chosen blending method and other parameters.
	- Combined Meshes Manager now has a bulletin board to communicate with you if you encounter any problems with
	  the merge.
	- It will now be possible to export the Atlas generated during the merge. Through the Combined Meshes Manager.
	- Easy Mesh Combiner now has a selection of "Combine Method". Through this selection, you can choose which
	  Combine Method Easy Mesh Combiner will use to combine your meshes! 
	  (If you are a user of the Skinned Mesh Combiner MT tool, you already know how it works!)
	- New Combine Method added: One Mesh Per Material. This method of blending works identically to the way in which
	  Easy Mesh Combiner has always worked! This is the standard Combine Method.
	- New Combine Method added: All In One. This method of merging supports and generates Atlas from the meshes that
	  have been selected for merging. In this merge method the Easy Mesh Combiner will combine the meshes that
	  have Tilings (in order to preserve the quality of these meshes as much as possible) and combine the meshes that
	  do not have Tilings, all together, generating an Atlas with various textures. You can decide how many textures
	  an Atlas can have, if you want to have a better control of the quality that each texture will have in the Atlas.
	  After all, only the mesh resulting from the merge will remain.
	- New Combine Method added: Just Material Colors. This method of blending only works with meshes that use only
	  colors in their materials, instead of textures. This blending method combines all meshes in just one mesh, then
	  extracts the color from all materials and creates a single Atals texture that works as a color palette,
	  containing all colors for all meshes combined. This will always optimize your meshes to generate only 1 Draw
	  Call at all times, while still retaining their original colors of the materials.
	- Now, when activating "Lightmaps Support", you will see a button called "Deselect Excessive". By clicking on
	  this button, Easy Mesh Combiner will deselect any excess GameObjects.
	- Fixed a bug that caused the vertex count to be increased after merge, in some rare cases.
	- Fixed a bug that caused the vertex count to be increased after merge, in some rare cases (For Runtime Mesh
	  Combiner too).
	- New function added to be performed after performing a merge: Now, when completing a merge with Easy Mesh Combiner
	  you can choose the option "Do Nothing" and so Easy Mesh Combiner will do absolutely nothing after performing
	  your merge! (For Editor)
	- New function added to be performed after performing a merge: Now, when completing a merge with Easy Mesh Combiner
	  you can choose the option "Do Nothing" and so Easy Mesh Combiner will do absolutely nothing after performing
	  your merge! (For Runtime Mesh Combiner too)

v2.6.4
	- Fixed some minor bugs and minor code changes.
	- The option to Optimize the mesh resulting from the merge has been added to the combined mesh manager.
	- An option to optimize the mesh was added to the Runtime Mesh Combiner component.
	- Now the management buttons of the combined mesh through the Editor, send messages for each action performed.
	- A button for quickly adding the Mesh Collider component, has been added to the combined mesh manager.
	- The documentation has been updated to contain minor changes and additions made in this version.

v2.6.3	
	- A bug has been fixed that caused the selection gizmos not to be hidden, after closing the merge window in
	  the Editor, without combining any mesh.
	- The UI of the merge window in the Editor, has undergone some improvements.
	- The options for recalculating normals and tangens have been moved from the merge window to the management
	  component of the combined mesh, which is on the mesh resulting from the merge.
	- Fixed a bug that caused disabled daughter meshes to still be combined, even if the "Combine Inactives"
	  option was unchecked.
	- The "Combined Meshes Manager" component now has an option so that it is possible to export the mesh resulting
	  from the merge, as OBJ, so the editing of this mesh in external modeling software is made easier.
	- Now the "Combine On Start" option of the "Runtime Mesh Combiner" has the options of "On Start" and "On Awake",
	  for greater control of when the merging should occur.
	- Now the GameObject that contains the mesh resulting from the merge will always be placed very close to the
	  first selected GameObject and in addition, it will also be the child of the first selected GameObject.
	- The component icons have been slightly updated.
	- Now the official version of the Easy Mesh Combiner, is 2019.3.x.
	- The documentation has been updated.

v2.5.2
	- Correction of small bugs.
	- There's more to come, soon!

v2.5.1
	- It is now possible to disable the calculation of normals and tangents of the meshes resulting from the merging.

v2.4.3
	- Correction of small bugs.

v2.4.2
	- A bug has been fixed that caused the automatic deactivation of some scripts' Gizmos to stop working.

	  of Unity 2019.3.x.

v2.4.1
	- Combined Meshes Manager is now not displayed in the component list.
	- Now the Gizmos of the RuntimeMeshCombiner and other components are no longer displayed.
	- Now, by default, the option to launch debug logs on the console, is enabled so that in case of any
	  runtime merging error, you know. You can always disable it if you prefer!
	- The documentation has been updated to ensure greater clarity, volume of information, tips and minor corrections!
	- Fixed a bug in the creation of prefabs, which affected versions newer to Unity 2018.3.
	- Now the meshes that are disabled, will not be included in the run-time merges, even if they are in the list
	  to merge.
	- Easy Mesh Combiner will no longer issue merge warnings about possible problems with Lightmaps, if you 
	  have not checked the support option for Lightmaps.

v2.4.0
	- Following the rhythm of Unity Engine versions and to guarantee the good permanent support of this asset,
	  now the minimum recommended version is 2018.1, however, you can still use this asset in the 2017.4 LTS
	  version if you prefer. This will allow this asset to always have the latest features and better and
	  more effective support!
	- Fixed a bug that caused the merging of very large meshes to suffer from distortions in the 2018.1
	  version of Unity.
	- Fixed a bug that caused GameObjects to be active, but with MeshFilters disabled, also be combined
	  while selecting all meshes or a GameObject that contains all meshes in the scenario.
	- Easy Mesh Combiner is now able to give an automatic name to the prefab you want to save.
	- To avoid problems, Easy Mesh Combiner will now only display the combined mesh management buttons,
	  in the original meshes and no longer in their respective prefabs.
	- The combined mesh manager interface has undergone some changes for clarity. Now the selection of
	  meshes combined by materials has a scrollview to make things more organized.

v2.3.0
	- In this version, some unused files have been removed from the package. For example, the demo scene
	  materials now use standard Unity shaders. Nothing that will affect the way the EMC works.
	- All resources, persistent asset data and other files are now saved in "MT Assets/_AssetsData".
	  This makes it easy to manage all files generated by MT assets and if you need to remove any asset,
	  just delete the asset folder. So, even if you want to remove some MT assets from your project, or
	  update it, you will not lose any files or information that you would like to keep!

v2.2.1
	- Fixed a bug that caused the compilation or loading time of the scene execution to increase considerably
	  in the editor.

v2.2.0
	- Now you no longer need to check the option of more than 64,000 vertices to combine giant meshes.

	  however, you can now choose the name of this GameObject before merging.
	- Easy Mesh Combiner should now work smoothly on versions older than 2017.4, but mesh support
	  with more than 65,000 vertices will not work on versions older than 2017.4.
